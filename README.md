# Development of a Relational Database to Support Post-Earthquake Building Damage & Recovery Modeling

I spent the summer working with the UCLA Civil and Environmental Engineering's Dr. Henry Burton sponsored by the National Science Foundation. I developed a relational database using MySQL to manage a large inventory of building damage and recovery modeling data. I also designed web crawling algorithms using Python & Selenium that reduced extraction time by 40% and added over 9,000 building attribute entries into the database

This repository showcases the web crawl code created to extract data from earthquake sites.
