# Development of a Relational Database to Support Post-Earthquake Building Damage & Recovery Modeling

# Overview
I spent the summer working with the UCLA Civil and Environmental Engineering's Dr. Henry Burton sponsored by the National Science Foundation and under the UCLA Summer Undergraduate Research Program. 

I developed a relational database using **MySQL** to manage a large inventory of building damage and recovery modeling data. I also designed **web crawling algorithms** using **Python** and **Selenium** that reduced extraction time by 40% and added over 9,000 building attribute entries into the database

This repository showcases the web crawl code created to extract data from earthquake sites.
